# DateFormatter Smith

*DateFormatter Smith* is a small SwiftUI app which helps finding a suitable date and time format.
It live converts an input date into a string using Swifts *Foundation* `DateFormatter` and converts the date into the most important time interval representations.

There are different input options (date, CoreData timestamp, Unix timestamp) to start with.
Apply a custom date format string (like "dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm") or use pre defined date and time styles.
See the live result of your format choices.

There are copy to/from pasteboard buttons for all the input/result
